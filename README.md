<b>Servo Micro</b>

Servo Micro is a self-contained replacement for Yoshi Servo flex. It is meant to be compatible with Servo v2/v3 via servod. The design uses case closed debug software on an STM32 MCU to provide a CCD interface into systems with a Yoshi debug port.<BR>

Servo Micro is usually paired with a Servo v4 Type-A, which provides ethernet, dut hub, and muxed usb storage.<BR>

See the detailed documentation in Servo Micro.
